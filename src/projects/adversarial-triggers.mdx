title: Universal Adversarial Triggers
description:
    "This project addresses universal adversarial triggers, which are input-agnostic
    sequences of words that cause a specific target prediction when prepended to any
    text in a dataset. Expanding on the work of Wallace et al. (2019), we considered alternative
    GRU, Feedforward Neural Network, and BERT models in the domain of sentiment analysis,
    which we used to generate both general and domain-specific triggers."
