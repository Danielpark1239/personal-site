description: 
    "To create my website, I utilized Gatsby, a blazingly-fast static site generator
    that follows the Jamstack approach. By leveraging the framework's MDX and GraphQL support,
    I was able to easily populate my React components and optimize my image variants with plugins such as gatsby-plugin-sharp.
    Through this project, I was also able to dive into CSS and responsive design using TailwindCSS,
    strengthening the weakest part of my development toolkit."
