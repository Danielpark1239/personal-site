description:
    "PROSPER is a digital scientific publication that connects parents to cutting-edge
    but accessible research in child health and development. The goal of the platform is to 
    help parents feel more confident and knowledgeable when it comes to making decisions about their
    child's health and well-being. As part of the backend team, I was able to implement features such as 
    a REST API, user authentication, role-based permissions, and email notifications."
