longDescription: 
    "I started this project in the summer of 2022, my original goal being to teach myself how to
    webscrape pages with Python. After writing the scraping modules, I wanted to make my project
    more accesible by turning it into a web app, so I taught myself the basics of Flask, HTML/CSS, and JS.
    Deploying the app posed a problem, however, as I hadn't thought about the system architecture at all
    and the http requests were timing out due to the long scraping tasks. On Heroku, I found a solution by 
    adding a worker dyno and using Redis to store job results as well as cache similar requests. I've been
    maintaining and upgrading the app ever since; I recently migrated the app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk and switched my task
    worker to Celery, and I'm planning on improving the frontend in the future."
