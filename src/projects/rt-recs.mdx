    "Web app that recommends new movies and tv shows based on the user's preferences,
    including genres, ratings, platforms, and Rotten Tomatoes scores. All information is 
    freshly scraped from the Rotten Tomatoes website, ensuring relevant results. The app currently supports six
    different functions including the ability to get recommendations that are similar to a movie/show you enjoy!"
longDescription: 
    "I started this project in the summer of 2022, my original goal being to teach myself how to
    webscrape pages with Python. After writing the scraping modules, I wanted to make my project
    more accesible by turning it into a web app, so I taught myself the basics of Flask, HTML/CSS, and JS.
    Deploying the app posed a problem, however, as I hadn't thought about the system architecture at all
    and the http requests were timing out due to the long scraping tasks. On Heroku, I found a solution by 
    adding a worker dyno and using Redis to store job results as well as cache similar requests. I've been
    maintaining and upgrading the app ever since; I recently migrated the app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk and switched my task
    worker to Celery, and I'm planning on improving the frontend in the future."
